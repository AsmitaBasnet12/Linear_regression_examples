# Linear Regression Examples

This repository contains examples of both **Simple Linear Regression** and **Multiple Linear Regression** using Python. 
These examples are designed to help beginners understand the fundamentals of regression analysis, including how to build models, 
interpret results, and visualize the outcomes.

Linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this repository, you will find examples demonstrating how to:

- Perform Simple Linear Regression with a single predictor.

- Perform Multiple Linear Regression with multiple predictors.

- Evaluate and visualize the performance of the regression models.
